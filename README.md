## üìå Information

**What is Hycord?** Hycord is a versatile Discord client I've developed, leveraging key features from various public Hypixel and general-purpose bots. From seamless Hypixel integration to robust moderation tools and everything in between, Hycord eliminates the need to clutter your server with numerous bots, ensuring a clean, professional, and fully customizable experience. While originally designed for Hypixel guild communities, Hycord's optional Hypixel integration module allows it to excel as a versatile all-purpose bot, as demonstrated in the accompanying images. This bot streamlines your server setup and enhances the gaming experience.

Should you run into any issues or bugs, please create an [issue ticket](https://github.com/KevinTrinh1227/Hycord-Bot/issues), or if interested, create a [pull request](https://github.com/KevinTrinh1227/Hycord-Bot/pulls). The native development version uses Python 3.10+ and has been tested on Linux and Windows 10+ OS.
